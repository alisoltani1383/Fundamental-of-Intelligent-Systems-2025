# Mini Project 1 — Fuzzy System & Neural Network Implementation

This mini-project is part of the **Fundamentals of Intelligent Systems** course and consists of two implementations that demonstrate key AI learning mechanisms: **Fuzzy Logic Modeling** and **Neural Network Learning**.

## 🧮 Part 1 — Fuzzy System (Q4)

### Objective
To implement a **fuzzy inference system** that predicts the **Mackey-Glass time series** using the **table lookup method**.

### Description
- Designed fuzzy sets and membership functions for input/output variables.  
- Constructed a fuzzy rule base to define relationships.  
- Implemented fuzzification, inference, and defuzzification processes.  
- Evaluated performance by comparing fuzzy predictions with actual values.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib

## 🧠 Part 2 — Neural Network (Q5)

### Objective
To develop and train a **single hidden-layer neural network (MLP)** for function approximation.

### Description
- Initialized network weights and biases.  
- Applied **delta learning rule** for supervised training.  
- Computed mean squared error (MSE) during training to assess convergence.  
- Visualized learning progress and final approximation accuracy.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn (optional utility functions)
