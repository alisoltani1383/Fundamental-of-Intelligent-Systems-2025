## 📝 Description

This project is part of **Mini Project 2** for the *Fundamentals of Intelligent Systems* course.  
It combines **mathematical derivations**, **conceptual analysis**, and **hands-on implementations** to study how intelligent systems perform classification and nonlinear function approximation.

The project includes:
- Analytical derivation of SVM formulations
- Manual and coded SVM solutions
- Static and adaptive RBF neural networks
- Performance evaluation and model comparison

All implementations are provided in a **Google Colab notebook**, and all theoretical explanations are documented in a **formal written report**.
