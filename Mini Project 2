## Project Overview

This mini project consists of **seven main questions**, combining mathematical derivations, conceptual reasoning, and practical machine learning implementations.

---

## Question Breakdown

### 1. Hard-Margin Support Vector Machine
- Primal optimization formulation

- Dual formulation and interpretation
- Role of support vectors and KKT conditions

---

### 2. Soft-Margin SVM with ℓ1 Slack Variables
- Primal problem with slack variables
- Connection to hinge loss
- Effect of regularization parameter **C**
- Bias–variance trade-off analysis

---

### 3. ℓ2 Soft-Margin SVM
- ℓ2-regularized primal and dual formulations
- Differences between ℓ1 and ℓ2 slack penalties
- Valid kernel definition (PSD condition)
- Polynomial and RBF kernel justification
- KKT conditions

---

### 4. Manual Hard-Margin SVM in ℝ²
- Analytical solution for a linearly separable dataset
- Explicit computation of:
  - Separating hyperplane
  - Margin
  - Support vectors

---

### 5. Nonlinear Classification and Model Selection
- Choosing appropriate models for nonlinear decision boundaries
- Comparison between MLPs and RBF networks
- Explanation of failure modes in global-activation networks

---

### 6. Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (Core Implementation)

This section represents the main computational contribution of the project.

#### Static RBF Neural Network
- Fixed number of Gaussian RBF units
- Random center selection from training samples
- Least-squares estimation of output weights
- Performance evaluation using RMSE on training and test data

#### Adaptive RBF Neural Network (M-RAN Inspired)
- Online learning with dynamic structure
- Neuron growth based on:
  - Input novelty
  - Prediction error
- Neuron pruning based on contribution threshold
- LMS-based weight updates
- Visualization of neuron count evolution
- Performance comparison with static RBFNN

---

### 7. Linear SVM Implementation and Hyperparameter Study
- Binary classification task
- Data preprocessing and standardization
- Train/validation/test split
- Effect of regularization parameter **C** on:
  - Margin width
  - Number of support vectors
  - Validation accuracy and F1-score
- PCA visualization (analysis only)
- ROC and Precision–Recall curves

---

## Key Results
- Adaptive RBFNN achieves **lower RMSE** with **fewer neurons** compared to static RBFNN.
- Linear SVM performs exceptionally well on near-linearly separable data.
- Regularization parameter **C** significantly affects generalization and margin behavior.
- PCA visualization confirms strong class separability.
