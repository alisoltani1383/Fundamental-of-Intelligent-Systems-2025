## **🧩 Mini Project 1 Overview**

The first mini-project focuses on two main parts:

1. **Q4 — Data Analysis and Preparation:**\
   This notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing on a customer dataset (`teleCust1000t.csv`).\
   It includes handling missing values, identifying feature types, data visualization, and experimenting with different imputation strategies.\
   The objective is to produce clean and well-structured data suitable for subsequent machine learning tasks.

2. **Q5 — Neural Network Learning:**\
   A simple **single hidden-layer neural network (MLP)** is trained to approximate nonlinear relationships.\
   The learning process is based on the **delta learning rule**, aiming to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between predicted and actual outputs.

## **🧩 Mini Project 2 Overview**

The second mini-project builds upon the fundamentals introduced earlier in the course and emphasizes more advanced intelligent system design and analysis.

Main objectives include:

* Designing and implementing intelligent models based on course methodologies

* Applying learning algorithms to practical datasets

* Evaluating model performance using appropriate quantitative metrics

* Analyzing model behavior, strengths, and limitations

All relevant notebooks, source code, and supporting materials for this mini-project are organized under the `MiniProject2/` directory.

## **🧩 Mini Project 3 Overview**

The third mini-project focuses on **Decision Trees** and **Ensemble Learning**, applying these concepts to the real-world **Titanic dataset**.

1.  **Decision Trees & Optimization (Q5 - Q6):**
    *   **Preprocessing:** Implemented cleaning strategies for missing values (`Age`, `Fare`, `Embarked`) and applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical features.
    *   **Tree Implementation:** Trained a baseline Decision Tree and analyzed the structure using visualization tools.
    *   **Cost-Complexity Pruning:** Applied Post-Pruning strategies to optimize the `ccp_alpha` parameter, effectively balancing the Bias-Variance tradeoff to prevent overfitting.

2.  **Ensemble Learning Applications (Q12):**
    *   **Random Forest & Gradient Boosting:** Implemented and compared these two powerful ensemble methods.
    *   **Performance Analysis:** Evaluated models based on Training vs. Test accuracy to diagnose "Severe Overfitting" vs. "Moderate Overfitting" and analyzed why Ensemble methods generally outperform single Decision Trees.

All relevant notebooks and reports are organized under the `MiniProject3/` directory.
