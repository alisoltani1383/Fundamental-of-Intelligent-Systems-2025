## 🧩 Mini Project 1 Overview

The first mini-project focuses on two main parts:

1. **Q4 — Data Analysis and Preparation:**  
   This notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing on a customer dataset (`teleCust1000t.csv`).  
   It includes handling missing values, identifying feature types, data visualization, and experimenting with different imputation strategies.  
   The objective is to produce clean and well-structured data suitable for subsequent machine learning tasks.

2. **Q5 — Neural Network Learning:**  
   A simple **single hidden-layer neural network (MLP)** is trained to approximate nonlinear relationships.  
   The learning process is based on the **delta learning rule**, aiming to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between predicted and actual outputs.

## 🧩 Mini Project 2 Overview

The second mini-project builds upon the fundamentals introduced earlier in the course and emphasizes more advanced intelligent system design and analysis.

Main objectives include:
- Designing and implementing intelligent models based on course methodologies  
- Applying learning algorithms to practical datasets  
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate quantitative metrics  
- Analyzing model behavior, strengths, and limitations  

All relevant notebooks, source code, and supporting materials for this mini-project are organized under the `MiniProject2/` directory.
