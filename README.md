## 🧩 Mini Project 1 Overview

The first mini-project focuses on two main parts:
1. **Q4 — Fuzzy System Implementation:**  
   A fuzzy logic system is designed to model and predict the **Mackey-Glass time series** using the **table lookup method**.  
   The fuzzy inference process includes membership function definition, rule base construction, and defuzzification to obtain the final outputs.

2. **Q5 — Neural Network Learning:**  
   A simple **single hidden-layer neural network (MLP)** is trained to approximate nonlinear relationships.  
   The learning process uses the **delta learning rule** to minimize mean squared error between predicted and actual outputs.
